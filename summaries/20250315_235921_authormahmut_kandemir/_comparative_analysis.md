### 2. **How These Papers Complement or Contradict Each Other**

- **Complementarity**:
  - *BaKlaVa* and *FilMBot* both focus on optimizing resource allocation but in different domains (GPU memory for LLMs vs. robotic control). Their methodologies could inspire cross-domain applications, such as using heuristic-based profiling in robotics or precision optimization in LLMs.
  - *EPPO* and *Pandora* both address dynamic environments but in different contexts (reinforcement learning vs. particle physics). Their approaches to handling uncertainty and non-stationarity could inform each other.
  - *In the Picture* and *Pandora* both emphasize the importance of high-quality data and annotations, with the former focusing on medical imaging datasets and the latter on neutrino interaction data.

- **Contradictions**:
  - There are no direct contradictions, but the papers differ in their primary objectives. For example, *BaKlaVa* prioritizes memory efficiency, while *FilMBot* prioritizes speed and precision. These differences highlight the trade-offs inherent in optimization problems.
