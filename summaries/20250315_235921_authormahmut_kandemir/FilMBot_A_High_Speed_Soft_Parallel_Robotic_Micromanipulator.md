## Abstract

Soft robotic manipulators are generally slow despite their great
adaptability, resilience, and compliance. This limitation also extends to
current soft robotic micromanipulators. Here, we introduce FilMBot, a 3-DOF
film-based, electromagnetically actuated, soft kinematic robotic
micromanipulator achieving speeds up to 2117 $\deg$/s and 2456 $\deg$/s in
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ angular motions, with corresponding linear velocities of
1.61 m/s and 1.92 m/s using a 4-cm needle end-effector, and 1.57 m/s along the
Z axis. The robot can reach ~1.50 m/s in path-following tasks, operates at
frequencies up to 30 Hz, and remains functional up to 50 Hz. It demonstrates
high precision (~6.3 $\mu$m, or ~0.05% of its workspace) in small
path-following tasks. The novel combination of the low-stiffness soft kinematic
film structure and strong electromagnetic actuation in FilMBot opens new
avenues for soft robotics. Furthermore, its simple construction and
inexpensive, readily accessible components could broaden the application of
micromanipulators beyond current academic and professional users.
