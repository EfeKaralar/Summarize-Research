## Abstract

This article highlights quantum Internet computing as referring to
distributed quantum computing over the quantum Internet, analogous to
(classical) Internet computing involving (classical) distributed computing over
the (classical) Internet. Relevant to quantum Internet computing would be areas
of study such as quantum protocols for distributed nodes using quantum
information for computations, quantum cloud computing, delegated verifiable
blind or private computing, non-local gates, and distributed quantum
applications, over Internet-scale distances.
